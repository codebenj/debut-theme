        <h1 class='my-4'>Dear fellow dropshipper...</h1>
        <p>The reason why 99% of new dropshippers fail isn’t lack of skill. It’s not a small budget. Heck, it’s not even a bad theme.</p>
        <p>I’ve seen countless guys like you repeat this same, stupid goddamn mistake… it’s starting to make me angry.</p>
        <p>I’ll tell you why...</p>
        <p>Imagine a typical dropshipping store. This is how it works:</p>
        <p>First, you run ads on Facebook/Google to get traffic to your store. Pay for each person that clicks your ad.</p>
        <p>Second, a small portion of the traffic buys your product.</p>
        <p>Third, you use retargeting to try and sell your product to the rest of the “clickers” - those who didn’t buy.</p>
        <p>Finally, you draw the bottom line. You add up all the sales, and subtract your spendings (marketing, product, shipping, etc.). What’s left is pure profit.</p>
        <p>Simple? Yes, in theory. <u><b>Profitable? Only for some.</b></u></p>
        <p>But why is that? Do you see where dropshipping fails?</p>
        <p>I’ll tell you why. There’s no step number four.</p>

        <h1 class='my-4'>The Big Problem Eating Your Dropshipping Profits</h1>
        
        <div class='lead'>
          <p>The big problem with dropshipping is low markups. (The ratio between profit and revenue.) If 40% of all your revenue is profit... consider yourself king. For most people, it isn’t.</p>
          <p>Most folks struggle to get 20% profit per sale, let alone forty…</p>
          <p>And this would be okay - if there were a step four.</p>
          <p>With a step four, you could have a markup close to zero. Yet you’d still cash in fat checks. You could live the ultimate lifestyle, and run a successful dropshipping business.</p>
          <p>Step four is what separates the big brands from small, one-hit-wonder stores. Step four is having a brand.</p>
          <p>You see, with a typical dropshipping store, customers buy from you once. And they never hear from you again.</p>
          <p>But, with a dropshipping brand, customers rave about you. They buy from you time and time again. With such a brand, you’re literally just one click away from cashing in your paycheck.</p>
          
          <p>And you don’t need to worry about marketing costs...</p>
          <p>You don’t need to worry about chargebacks and refunds...</p>
          <p>You don’t even need to worry if they’ll like your product. You simply know they will.</p>
          <p>This is because brand customers already know your store and trust you. They know you because they bought from you before. They trust you because they love your product.</p>
          <p>Simply put, they’re loyal to your store. Loyal to your brand. And you can use this to sell new products with mind-blowing profit markups.</p>

          <h1 class='mb-4'>Sell New Products With Mind-Blowing Revenue</h1>
          <p>This money-making mechanism is very simple. The first 3 steps work like a typical dropshipping store, and the fourth adds the icing on the cake: </p>
          <p>1. Step one: get customers to your store through Facebook, Google, etc.</p>
          <p>2. Step two: sell your first product.</p>
          <p>3. Step three: retarget the ones who didn’t buy.</p>
          <p>4. <b>Step four: create a new product, and sell it to your brand customers (previous customers).</b></p>
          <p>And here’s the beauty of it...</p>       
          <p>You won’t need to waste time or money testing new audiences...</p>
          <p>It’s much, much easier to find new products your customers will love...</p>
          <p>You can create <u><b>high-converting product pages</b></u> in minutes.</p>
          <p>And you don’t have to waste hundreds of dollars on ads.</p>
          <p>All this by adding in a simple and easy step number four.</p>
          <p>Now, since you’re just starting out… you’re probably wondering how to do this crucial step number four.</p>
          <p>Well, I’ve never had anyone teach me. It was trial & error, until I figured it out. That’s why I created this FREE webinar, so you can learn it quickly and easily, and without breaking your back.</p>
          <p>In the free webinar, I reveal the 3 fundamental secrets behind building a fully-fledged dropshipping brand, that can support the lifestyle you desire for years.</p>
