				communicating personal information via the Internet. If a password is used to protect the
				User’s account and his personal information, it is his responsibility to keep it confidential.

				unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Debutify will promptly
				investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours
